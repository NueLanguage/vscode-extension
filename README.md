***Experiencing Nue for the first time just got a whole lot better.***

An extension for Visual Studio Code which adds syntax highlighting, file associations, code recognition and a few other features like icons to support the Nue programming language.

At the moment, this extension adds weak support for Nue using TextMate grammars and other configurations.

A full LSP-based extension will be developed as Nue further progresses as a programming language in development.
